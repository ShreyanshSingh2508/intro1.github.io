           Greetings to the visitors<br>
           This is <b>Shreyansh Kumar Singh</b>.
           I belong to CSE core, section D specifically.<br>
           I do socialise with people arround me very easily<br>
           But this task gave me the oppurtunity to think of new fancy ways inorder to stand out from the crowd...<br>
           
           
           As a junior I would like to request you to<br>
           teach me as I am inexperienced <br>
           guide me when I need help<br>
           reprimand me to have discipline <br>
           support me when I feel incomfortable<br>
           
           And I must say meeting you all in our first interaction has made me realise that you all know your roles much better💯<br>
           Just cant stop thinking of the good memorable times we will create🍻✨<br>
           looking forward to meet you all individually too😁<br>


           PS: I tried my best to keep it short but that extrovert me just kicked in😅<br>
